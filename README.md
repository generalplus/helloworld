# hello, world

We are on a quest to look for the best "Hello world" program in
Taiwan! Please fork this project, commit your own implementation, and
send a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) if
you are interested in joining us.

## Requirements

We want you to show us your best work. Hence, we are not imposing too
much restriction on how you create your "Hello world" program.
However, please include at least the following items.

### Source code

Any language is acceptable. You might want to consider picking one of
the [top languages](https://github.com/languages) from GitHub though.

### Documentation

Explain to us how you designed and executed your code.

## Go the extra mile

If you are feeling fancy, by all means add more enhancements to your
project. For example:

* Makefile (or Rakefile, Jakefile, build.xml, CMakeLists.txt, etc.)
* Unit testing
* Hook up on [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/)
* Briefly explain your coding conventions (such as [PEP8][1] or
  [CoffeeScript Style Guide][2])
